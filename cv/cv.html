	<h2>Experience: What am I learning or practising at the moment?</h2>
	
	<p>I am pursuing my final year of bachelor degree of computer science and information system. During this first trimester of study at university, I have got some more applicable knowledge which is relevant to my future career such as Python programming, Artificial Intelligence, Java programming, Software testing, Operation Research (Queuing theory) and so on. <br><br>
Besides, I am currently sharpening my web development skill by applying and studying with Udemy (The Complete front end web developer Bootcamp). With all the experience and knowledge from Udemy online course, I am also developing a commercial website for my boss at KK Malaysia Restaurant in Wellington in order to apply my brand new skills. That has been a very exciting project for me.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Role fit: What can I contribute to a role? Why should I be hired?</h2>
	<p>I am a person with various problem-solving skills and encouraging attitude towards many difficulties and I can get along or collaborate with different people easily to work in a project. <br><br>
In addition to my positive attitudes and personal academic knowledge that I had learnt so far, I would still love to devote more of my time in your institution to gain more working experience through any internship or job training programs. It is very crucial for me to develop my connection to this local IT environment, learn unceasingly and apply my hand-on skills and techniques to make great contribution to your company. </p>
