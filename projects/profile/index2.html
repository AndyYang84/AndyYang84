	 <p>Music is an important part of my life as it provides me with relaxation and happiness when I listen or play it.
	 I can play violin well and I have been</br> learning to play it for about ten years. It was fun but also lots of work to practice. Moreover, I bought
	 a flute and enjoyed self-learning experience in</br> the begining of 2015, the year I came here to Wellington to study. They are both my best friends.</p>
	 
	 <li>COOKING</li>

	 <p>I am really carzy about attempting new cuisine and cooking at home because they inspire me a lots that eating well is the key to maintaining</br> health. I like to 
	 buy raw materials, fresh fruits, vegetable from the market and cook on my own after I have discover a fabulous receipe online.</p>
