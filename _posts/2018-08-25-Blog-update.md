I just encountered a problem dealing with Jekyll post Files plugin.
The original version with this blog post site was meant to display the same default layout as the homepage has.
However, due to the problem that the footer social media images could not show up, I decided to change the whole post layout
into some colorful blocks with a back button to link user back to the blog page.
Sorry for any inconvenience. I am trying to learn more about Jekyll post files plugin so that I can upload multiple types of files onto my posts.
