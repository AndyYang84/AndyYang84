Hi there! I made another small project with the guide taught by a Udemy course.
This time the topic is about using components from Bootstrap to make a responsive landing page.
You can find my work [here](https://andyyang84.github.io/projects/Technical_landing_project/index.html)!
(p.s. I am still working on it to make more functionalities.)

All the best! :)
