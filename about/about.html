	<p>I am a BSc student at Victoria University of Wellington, completing my degree soon in the end of November, 2018. 
	<br><br>I am looking for a job where I can further develop and apply my computer science and information system skills through practical experience and where I am able to contribute to the community through more reliable software.
	<br><br>
	My current career goal is to become a website/application developer. I love to involve myself in a vibrant team where I can really make a difference. I am able to fit myself in a flexiable and dynamic working environment.
	<br><br>
	I am passionate about music, playing and teaching the violin and flute. I have been playing the violin since I was seven years old.</p>
