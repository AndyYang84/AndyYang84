	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am a BSc student at Victoria University of Wellington and I am finishing my degree soon in the end of November, 2018. 
	<br><br>I am looking for a job where I can further develop and apply my computer science and information system skills through practical experience and where I can make a contribution to the community through the development of software in New Zealand.
	<br><br>
	My current career goal is to become a website/application developer. I love to involve myself into a vibrant teamwork and develop cool website or mobile application collaboratively. I am able to fit myself in a flexiable and dynamic working environment.
	<br><br>
	I play the violin and the flute really well. I have been playing the violin since I was 7 years old.</p>
